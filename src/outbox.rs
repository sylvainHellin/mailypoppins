//! The durable outbox: submission state that survives a kill -9 (#0037 item 5).
//!
//! Best-effort "SMTP, then APPEND to Sent and hope" is exactly the design that
//! loses sent mail in Thunderbird, mutt and aerc
//! (`.agents/research/sent-folder-durability-in-mail-clients.md`). The store
//! makes the alternative cheap: the raw RFC822 bytes and a row describing what
//! must happen to them are committed *before* the SMTP conversation starts, so
//! every crash window has a defined recovery.
//!
//! ## The state machine
//!
//! ```text
//!            enqueue                submit 250              append acked
//!   (nothing) ------> pending_send ------------> sent_pending_append ------> done
//!                          |  ^                         ^     |
//!         clean pre-submission failure                  |     | append failed
//!                          |  |  (attempts += 1,        '-----'  (attempts += 1)
//!                          |  |   marker cleared)
//!                          |  '------------------ retry (operator, from failed)
//!                          |
//!            ambiguous SMTP failure --> failed  (manual inspection, never re-sent)
//!            crash after the marker --> failed  (same rule, decided on resume)
//! ```
//!
//! Every arrow is one committed transaction, and each state answers exactly one
//! question about a process that died mid-send:
//!
//! - `pending_send`: SMTP has provably not been accepted, so the resume path
//!   submits. A crash between the commit and the SMTP conversation lands here,
//!   and re-sending is correct because the server never saw the message.
//!   "Provably" is what `submission_started_at` buys: the sender commits that
//!   marker immediately before it opens the SMTP session, so a `pending_send`
//!   row found on restart with a NULL marker was never attempted, while one
//!   with a marker died somewhere inside the conversation and is as ambiguous
//!   as a dropped connection. [`sweep_pending_sends`] hands the first kind
//!   back for submission and moves the second to `failed`.
//! - `sent_pending_append`: the server returned 250 and owns the message now.
//!   SMTP must never run again for this row; only the APPEND is retried. A crash
//!   between the 250 and the APPEND lands here.
//! - `failed`: an *ambiguous* SMTP failure, where the message may or may not
//!   have been accepted. Automatic recovery cannot be safe in either direction,
//!   so the row stops here for a human. It is never auto re-sent.
//! - `done`: the message is in the Sent mailbox (or the account does not want a
//!   local APPEND at all, see [`crate::config::appends_to_sent`]).
//!
//! ## One verdict per recipient
//!
//! SMTP here is one conversation per recipient ([`crate::send::submit`]), so
//! "the message was accepted" is not a fact about the message: a submission can
//! end with one recipient holding it, one refused for good and one still to
//! try. That is what [`SubmitOutcome::PerRecipient`] carries and what the
//! [`Envelope`] records, next to the addresses themselves (#0063). The four
//! states above still describe the row, and the verdicts decide which one it
//! moves to:
//!
//! - a recipient with no verdict parks the row in `failed`, whatever the
//!   others did;
//! - a recipient that can still be tried keeps the row in `pending_send`, one
//!   attempt older, and the next pass attempts only the recipients that are
//!   still outstanding;
//! - once nothing is outstanding the row goes on to `sent_pending_append` (or
//!   straight to `done`) if anybody took the message, and to `failed` if the
//!   server refused them all.
//!
//! A message that reached some of its recipients and not others keeps a note in
//! `last_error` for good, which is what keeps the row in
//! [`unfinished_rows`] after it is `done`: an operator has to be told which
//! recipient never got it, and there is nowhere else to tell them.
//!
//! ## One drain per account
//!
//! [`drain`] is the state machine and takes no lock, so two of them running at
//! once for one account each read the open rows, each miss what the other has
//! not finished, and each APPEND them. That is not hypothetical: every send
//! calls the drain to file its own Sent copy, so six sends inside six seconds
//! ran six overlapping drains and left the oldest message in Sent six times
//! (#0116). [`drain_guarded`] is therefore the only entry point the live path
//! uses. It runs the pass under the same per-account advisory lock the
//! mutation queue drains under ([`crate::engine_lock`]), so at most one drain
//! per account exists at a time, in this process or any other, and a drain
//! that is refused the lock does nothing at all rather than duplicating work
//! the holder is already doing. The holder sweeps again while a pass completed
//! something, and every sweep reads the clock afresh, so a row a refused peer
//! left behind, stamped while the holder was inside its APPEND, is filed by
//! the holder instead of waiting for the next tick.
//!
//! `flock` is what makes the lock safe to hold across a slow APPEND: the
//! kernel releases it when the holding fd closes, however the holder went
//! away, so a killed process leaves nothing to reap and no lease to expire.
//! What a killed process does leave is a row whose APPEND may or may not have
//! landed, which is why the attempt is committed to the row *before* the
//! APPEND runs (see below) rather than after it.
//!
//! ## Exactly once
//!
//! SMTP runs at most once per row *and recipient*: [`record_submission`] is the
//! only writer that leaves `pending_send`, the marker turns "we may have
//! submitted" into a committed fact, the driver only submits rows still in that
//! state with no marker, and a resubmission attempts
//! [`Envelope::outstanding`] rather than the whole address list, so a recipient
//! that answered 250 is never spoken to twice. [`retry`] re-arms a `failed` row
//! for a human who has established that the message did not arrive; it clears
//! the marker, so the row is again a single-attempt row rather than a second
//! attempt on top of an unknown first, and it inherits the same delivered set.
//! The APPEND is idempotent by construction instead: an attempt that is not
//! the row's first (`attempts > 0`) runs `UID SEARCH HEADER MESSAGE-ID` in the
//! Sent mailbox first and skips the APPEND on a hit, because the earlier
//! attempt may have been ambiguous in the same way SMTP can be. `APPENDUID` is
//! the definitive acknowledgement and its UID is stored on the row.
//!
//! `attempts` counts APPENDs *started*, not APPENDs that failed: the increment
//! is committed immediately before the request goes out, which is the same
//! trick `submission_started_at` plays for SMTP. A drain that dies inside its
//! APPEND therefore leaves `attempts > 0` behind, so the drain that reclaims
//! the row runs the dedup search first instead of blindly appending a copy the
//! server may already hold. The first attempt on a row still costs no search,
//! because the decision reads the counter as it was before the increment.
//!
//! ## The admission gate
//!
//! Nothing above helps if the same message is queued twice, and a draft is one
//! message however many times send is pressed: every build mints a fresh
//! `Message-ID`, so a second submission looks unrelated to this state machine
//! and to the Sent dedup search. The envelope therefore carries the draft it
//! was built from, and [`enqueue`] refuses a draft that already has a row the
//! outbox owns ([`AlreadyInFlight`]). The in-process half of the gate lives
//! with the caller that races with itself, [`crate::send::send_draft`].
//!
//! ## Blob refcounting
//!
//! The raw bytes live in the content-addressed blob store like any other blob,
//! and the outbox row holds a plain `blobs`-table reference taken by
//! [`crate::store::BlobStore::acquire`] with **no `message_blobs` row**: that
//! table's foreign key targets `messages`, and an outbox row is a submission,
//! not a message. The reference is released when the row reaches `done`, and
//! when a `failed` row is explicitly discarded with [`discard`] -- never on the
//! transition into `failed` itself, because the whole point of that state is
//! that a human can still read the bytes that did not make it.
//!
//! ## Surviving a store rebuild
//!
//! The rest of the store is dropped and rebuilt when its file goes bad or its
//! schema version moves, because the server holds it back. Nothing holds an
//! outbox row back, so it is carried across the rebuild instead, with its raw
//! blob (#0066, [`crate::store::rebuild`]). A row that cannot be carried is
//! named in a note file next to the store rather than discarded silently.
//!
//! ## Transport seam
//!
//! [`SentMailbox`] is the only thing this module knows about IMAP. The live
//! implementation is [`crate::imap_client::ImapSentMailbox`]; tests drive the
//! state machine against an in-memory fake, so every crash window is covered
//! offline and deterministically.
