//! iMIP invite reconciliation over the store (#0030, moved onto rows and blobs
//! by [#0038](../docs/tickets/0038-read-path-to-db.md) scope item 6).
//!
//! An organizer's invitation is a `METHOD:REQUEST` message; an attendee's
//! answer is a `METHOD:REPLY` carrying that attendee's `PARTSTAT`. Both arrive
//! as ordinary mail and both are ingested as an ordinary row with an
//! `invite.ics` attachment blob. Reconciliation folds the replies onto the
//! invite so the organizer sees who responded, and so an attendee sees their
//! own answer on the invite they answered.
//!
//! # Derived, not stored
//!
//! Nothing here writes. The pre-store build rewrote `event.attendees[].status`
//! into the invite's `.md` frontmatter, but the store is a cache in front of
//! the server (a schema mismatch drops the whole file, `crate::store::schema`),
//! so a persisted fold would be a second source of truth that can drift from
//! the blobs it was computed from, and it buys nothing that recomputing does
//! not. The fold therefore runs where the answer is displayed, over the same
//! rows every time:
//!
//! - **Idempotent** by construction: there is no state to converge.
//! - **Multi-machine consistent** by construction: two machines holding the
//!   same messages compute the same statuses with no machine-to-machine sync.
//! - **Cheap**: an invite is a rare row, the query is one index-driven join,
//!   and each ics is a few kilobytes.
//!
//! `mp calendar rebuild` therefore reports what the fold resolves instead of
//! rewriting files, and [`ReconcileReport`] is a report rather than a diff.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! 1. [`load_invites`] reads every row of the account that carries an
//!    `invite.ics` blob and parses it. The ics is the only source: there is no
//!    frontmatter cache left to drift from it, which also removes the
//!    attachment-`.md` forgery surface TKT-0047 described (there is no `.md`
//!    on disk to walk, and an attachment blob is not a message row).
//! 2. [`fold_replies`] indexes the REPLYs by UID and attendee address
//!    (case-insensitive). The winner per address is the reply with the highest
//!    `(sequence, dtstamp)`: a newer sequence supersedes, ties break on the
//!    later `DTSTAMP`.
//! 3. [`apply_replies`] writes the winning `PARTSTAT`s onto an invite's
//!    in-memory attendee list, skipping replies older than the invite's own
//!    sequence. An address that was never invited is ignored: the attendee
//!    list belongs to the organizer's invitation.
