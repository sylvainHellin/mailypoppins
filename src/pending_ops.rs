//! The durable mutation queue: a flag, move or delete that survives a kill -9.
//!
//! Stage 3 of the data-access-layer redesign (#0039). Archive, delete, move and
//! mark-read / mark-unread change server-side state the server still holds, so
//! losing one loses a flag change or delays a move, never a message. Send is not
//! a kind here: it has the stricter [`crate::outbox`] state machine, because
//! SMTP is not retryable the way a flag toggle is.
//!
//! This is the mutation twin of the outbox, and it follows the same durability
//! patterns rather than inventing parallel ones:
//!
//! - the local write and the queue row commit in **one** transaction
//!   ([`apply_move`], [`apply_delete`], [`apply_set_read`], [`apply_set_flagged`]),
//!   so a crash can never leave the store optimistically changed with no durable
//!   record of the op it owes the server, nor an op row for a change that never
//!   landed locally;
//! - a background engine drains the queue ([`drain`]) with exponential backoff
//!   (the same [`crate::outbox::backoff_secs`] curve), on startup and on the
//!   sync tick, exactly where [`crate::send::resume_outbox`] already runs;
//! - replay is exactly-once for the local half by construction: the local write
//!   happened once, inside the commit, and the drain **never re-applies it**. It
//!   runs only the server op, and the drain **converges** that op on replay. A
//!   move, delete or flag whose server half already landed before the crash
//!   replays against a message the source folder no longer holds; both backends
//!   report that as a typed [`crate::ops::NotFoundOnServer`], which the drain
//!   treats as success and retires the row. So a crash between the server op and
//!   the row's retirement re-runs the op and converges, rather than parking a
//!   succeeded op as `failed` and rolling the local state back under it;
//! - two drains racing on these rows is the destructive case the engine
//!   advisory lock ([`crate::engine_lock`], #0061) exists to exclude, so a live
//!   drain runs under that lock ([`drain_account`]).
//!
//! ## States
//!
//! Simpler than the outbox, because a mutation is single-phase (there is no
//! APPEND-to-Sent second leg):
//!
//! - `queued`: the local write is committed and the server op is owed. The
//!   drain attempts it under backoff.
//! - a successful op **deletes** the row: a done mutation has nothing an
//!   operator can act on, unlike a `done` send that may carry a partial-delivery
//!   note, so there is nothing to retain.
//! - `failed`: the op was refused past its retry budget. The row is kept so the
//!   failure is visible, and the local state is rolled back to the server's:
//!   a moved row goes home, a flag toggle is undone. A delete has nothing to
//!   restore (the row is gone), so it converges when the next sync refetches the
//!   UID the server never dropped, which is the same answer
//!   [`crate::store::write`] already gives.
//!
//! ## Addressing
//!
//! `target_message_id` is the `messages` row id, for correlation with the store
//! (#0039 amendment); the full server addressing rides in the JSON payload as a
//! [`ServerOp`], which names the message by `Message-ID`. The row already knows
//! the exact `(mailbox, uid)`, and carrying the uid on the op to skip the
//! full-mailbox `UID SEARCH HEADER` is a latency refinement the amendment notes;
//! this first cut keeps the Message-ID addressing the outbox's Sent dedup relies
//! on, because it is the proven seam and needs no widening of the `imap_client`
//! op signatures.
