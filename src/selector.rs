//! The `mp://` selector contract: one grammar, one parser, one formatter.
//!
//! Paths are gone from every CLI input position (#0050). A message is named by
//!
//! ```text
//! selector := [ "mp://" account "/" ] [ mailbox "/" ] key
//! ```
//!
//! and the canonical form every command *prints* is the fully qualified
//! `mp://<account>/<mailbox>/<key>`. Elision is positional and deterministic,
//! never sniffed: without the scheme the account comes from `-A/--account` or
//! the default account, and the mailbox comes from `--mailbox` or the
//! command's declared default scope. Segment counts alone decide what was
//! elided, which works because the key is percent-encoded and therefore
//! contains no raw `/`.
//!
//! The parser never inspects the string to decide *what kind of thing* it is.
//! The [`Namespace`] is fixed by the command that called it: `mp archive` is
//! always received mail, `mp send` is always a draft. That is the whole reason
//! the two namespaces can share one grammar without a sniffing rule that would
//! silently reinterpret a key the day a Message-ID happens to look like a
//! draft id.
//!
//! Resolution ([`resolve_received`], [`resolve_draft`]) is a single indexed
//! lookup. Zero matches names the namespace searched; more than one match (the
//! cross-mailbox copy) lists every fully qualified candidate and asks for
//! `--mailbox`, and never picks one.
//!
//! # The effective account is the selector's, resolved before any store opens
//!
//! A selector's own `mp://<account>/…` segment overrides `-A/--account` and the
//! default, the same way its mailbox segment overrides `--mailbox`: naming a
//! thing inside the selector is the more specific statement. The consequence a
//! caller must honour is an ordering one. The account is resolved from the
//! selector *before* any store is opened or any server credential is loaded, so
//! a cross-account selector addresses its own account's index and transport.
//! Opening the default account's store first and resolving against it turns a
//! valid cross-account selector into a wrong-store miss whose error even prints
//! the selector's account as the scope it searched, which is actively
//! misleading (the #0073 follow-up bug: `mp delete mp://tum/drafts/<id>` under a
//! `perso` default). A command whose transport is bound before the selector is
//! parsed (`mp send`, `mp invite`) cannot honour a cross-account selector
//! cheaply; it fails loudly with "selector names account X but this command is
//! bound to Y" rather than operate on the wrong account. No command silently
//! resolves a selector against an account the selector did not name.
