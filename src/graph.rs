// Microsoft Graph API REST client for Exchange Online mail operations.
//
// Provides a stateless HTTP client that wraps `reqwest::Client` + OAuth2 access token.
// Each function corresponds to a Graph API endpoint and returns domain types
// (`FetchedEmail`, folder lists, etc.). Those are what `src/ingest.rs` writes
// into the per-account store and blob store, the same landing point the IMAP
// backend uses; this module never touches the filesystem itself.

// Phase 4: sync_mailboxes_graph
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Sync orchestrator for Graph accounts, store-only. Mirrors the IMAP
/// `sync_mailboxes`, with two documented differences forced by the API:
///
/// - Graph never returns the original RFC822, so rows get `raw_blob` NULL and
///   the body/attachment blobs are the only copies of the content;
/// - Graph has no UID, so the row's `uid` is [`crate::ingest::graph_uid`] of
///   the message's `Message-ID`, which is stable per message and keeps the
///   `UNIQUE (account, mailbox, uid)` identity meaningful.
///
/// The orchestration mirrors [`crate::imap_client::sync_mailboxes`] line for
/// line, prune second pass included: the prunes are held back until every
/// target has been ingested, so a message archived in Outlook web has its
/// archive row before its inbox row goes and never spends a window with no row
/// anywhere (#0055).
///
/// Three conditions gate that prune, standing in for the IMAP window clamp
/// (#0065): the pass must have enumerated every target in full, it must have
/// landed every new message it found (a quick sync's `limit`, a batch
/// sub-response failure, a throttle that ran the pass out of budget and an
/// ingest error all count against this), and a row dated within
/// [`crate::ingest::PRUNE_MIN_AGE_SECS`] of now is left alone. Without the
/// first two, a message moved between two folders loses its source row in the
/// pass that could not fetch its destination copy, and holds no row anywhere
/// until the backlog drains.
///
/// Since #0042 a quick sync may replace the enumeration with a
/// `/messages/delta` walk from the token in `sync_cursors.deltalink`. The
/// delta is strictly an accelerator: [`delta_verdict`] refuses it on anything
/// unusual, any doubt during the walk throws the token away
/// ([`DeltaDiscard`]), a delta that reports removals hands the pass back to the
/// enumeration ([`FolderDelta::forces_full_enumeration`]), a full sync always
/// relists, and a token is only ever minted by a pass that saw the whole
/// folder and wrote every message in it ([`may_record_delta_token`]).
