//! Persistent authenticated IMAP sessions, shared for the life of the process
//! (#0041).
//!
//! Until this module every IMAP operation paid a full TCP handshake, a TLS
//! handshake and a LOGIN: archiving three messages meant three logins, and a
//! sync of three mailboxes meant three more. The server does not care, but the
//! user waits for all of it, and on a phone-tethered link the login alone was
//! most of the `[TIMING]` line.
//!
//! The replacement is a checkout pool rather than a single session, because
//! IMAP allows exactly one SELECTed mailbox per connection: the parallel
//! per-mailbox fetch (#0005) genuinely needs N connections at once, and one
//! shared session would serialise it. What the pool changes is that those
//! connections *survive* the operation that opened them, so the next one
//! borrows an authenticated session instead of building one.
//!
//! This is the module that rewrites the "one session per operation" invariant
//! in `docs/architecture.md`, with the owner's approval, as the ticket says.
//!
//! # What makes reuse safe
//!
//! A pooled connection is a piece of server-side state that can rot while it
//! sits idle: the server may have dropped it (RFC 3501 permits an autologout
//! after 30 minutes), a NAT may have forgotten the mapping, and a previous
//! borrower may have left it SELECTed on some other mailbox.
//!
//! - Every borrower re-`SELECT`s what it needs. That is not a new rule; every
//!   call site already did it, because it could never assume a mailbox.
//! - A session idle longer than [`IDLE_MAX`] is closed rather than reused.
//! - A session idle longer than [`PROBE_AFTER`] is `NOOP`-probed on checkout;
//!   a probe that fails costs one round trip and yields a fresh login. This is
//!   also the keepalive: the probe is what tells a half-dead connection from a
//!   live one before an operation commits to it.
//! - A borrower whose operation failed [`PooledSession::poison`]s the session,
//!   so a connection abandoned mid-response can never hand its leftover bytes
//!   to the next borrower. Every conversion of a call site does this through
//!   [`PooledSession::check`].
//!
//! # What is deliberately not pooled
//!
//! The IDLE watcher (`super::watch`). IDLE blocks its connection for its whole
//! duration, so it takes a dedicated one, which is the second connection the
//! ticket describes. Logging in and out is the least of its costs.
