//! IMAP sync, store-only.
//!
//! Replaces the `.md`-writing orchestrator: one IMAP session per sync, and
//! every message that comes back goes through [`crate::ingest`] into the
//! per-account `store.sqlite3` plus its blob store. Nothing is written to the
//! mailbox directories.
//!
//! Three things the old path did are gone with it, because the store makes
//! them unnecessary rather than merely cheaper:
//!
//! - the local Message-ID scan that decided what was new (identity is the UID,
//!   and the store answers "which UIDs do I hold" with one query);
//! - the dedup pass over the mailbox directory (the unique constraint on
//!   `(account, mailbox, uid)` makes a duplicate impossible);
//! - the EXISTS/UIDNEXT reconciliation heuristic and its `mailbox-states.json`
//!   cache (superseded by `sync_cursors`; a row the server no longer lists is
//!   pruned from the fetch's own enumeration of the mailbox, see
//!   [`crate::imap_client::vanished_uids`]).
