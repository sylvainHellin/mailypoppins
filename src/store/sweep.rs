//! The retention sweep: the one code path in mailypoppins that deletes user
//! data (#0060).
//!
//! The local store is a cache in front of the server, so evicting a blob is not
//! deletion in the durable sense: the `messages` row stays, the listing stays
//! complete, and the bytes are re-materialised by a re-ingest of the same UID
//! (see [`docs/tickets/0060-retention-enforcement.md`] and the interim note in
//! [`crate::config`] at the `RetentionPolicy` docs). Message rows are *never*
//! touched here; only blob files and their `blobs` refcount rows go.
//!
//! ## Marker mechanics (the two-strike rule)
//!
//! A sweep over an over-cap store does not evict on the first breach. It writes
//! a persisted, store-level marker (`meta[`[`RETENTION_OVER_CAP_MARKER`]`]`) and
//! warns. The *next* over-cap sweep sees the marker and evicts. Dropping back
//! under the cap clears the marker, so a store that briefly spikes and recovers
//! never loses a byte. The marker lives in `meta`, not in process memory, so the
//! "first breach warns, second evicts" contract holds across separate `mp`
//! invocations (a sync that warns, then a later `mp store gc` that evicts).
//!
//! ## Eviction order
//!
//! When a sweep does evict, victims are taken in this priority, oldest-first
//! within each group, stopping the moment the store is back under the cap:
//!
//! 1. blobs past their age horizon (attachments past `attachment_horizon_days`,
//!    then bodies past `body_horizon_days`), if the horizon is configured;
//! 2. attachment blobs, oldest-first;
//! 3. body blobs, oldest-first.
//!
//! "Age" is the freshest referencing message's `date_sort`: a blob is as recent
//! as its most recent use, so a shared attachment survives while any message
//! that still references it is inside the horizon. Raw RFC822 blobs and Graph
//! `html` blobs are not evicted (the spec's order names only attachments and
//! bodies); an all-raw store above its cap is a known, reported limitation.
//!
//! ## Transaction discipline
//!
//! The plan is computed from a read, then each victim is unlinked-then-deleted
//! in its own statement, mirroring [`BlobStore::release`]'s survivable order (a
//! file gone before its row is a hole the read path already degrades and the
//! next sweep re-reaps; a row gone before its file leaks disk). SQLite
//! serialises writers under WAL with the store's busy timeout, so a sweep and a
//! concurrent ingest transaction cannot interleave mid-statement: the sweep
//! only ever sees committed blobs, and never evicts a blob an in-flight ingest
//! has not yet committed.
//!
//! ## Pinned blobs (`ANO-6`)
//!
//! [`sweep_pinned`] is [`sweep`] plus the set of blobs a daemon client has
//! materialised and not yet released: a pinned hash is dropped from the eviction
//! plan, so the sweep cannot pull a file out from under a viewer that has it
//! open. A pin changes *who may be a victim* and nothing else. It does not
//! change `before_bytes`, because a pinned blob is resident disk and the cap is
//! a statement about disk; it does not change the marker rule, because a first
//! over-cap sweep warns whether or not anything is pinned; and the half-store
//! guard compares the pinned-free plan against `before_bytes`, so a refusal is
//! still a refusal about what would really have been deleted. `--force`
//! overrules the guard, which is a fat-finger rule about volume, and never the
//! pin, which is a correctness rule about a file another process has open.
//! A sweep that cannot reach the cap because of pins leaves the marker set, and
//! the next sweep after the release evicts.
