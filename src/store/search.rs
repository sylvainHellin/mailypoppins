//! Full-text search over the store's FTS5 index (#0043).
//!
//! Search is a `SELECT`, not a file stream. The index (`messages_fts`) has
//! existed since #0038 and is written inside the same transaction as the
//! `messages` row it describes ([`crate::ingest`]), and removed by every
//! delete path (`store::write::delete_row`, `pending_ops::apply_delete`, and
//! the prune through `delete_by_uid`), so it never needs a reconcile pass.
//! What was missing was a way to ask it a question; this module is that.
//!
//! Two constraints come from the index being *contentless*
//! (`content=''`, `contentless_delete=1`, see [`super::schema`]):
//!
//! - Only `rowid`-returning `MATCH` queries work. `snippet()` and
//!   `highlight()` fail, so a hit is rendered from the `messages` row it joins
//!   to (which is where the stored snippet lives) and never from the index.
//! - There is nothing to rebuild the index *from*: the body text lives in a
//!   blob and the index keeps no copy. That is not a gap, because the store is
//!   a cache with a drop-and-rebuild contract: a file whose index is suspect is
//!   deleted and refilled by the next sync. [`index_drift`] is the check that
//!   says whether it is suspect, so the question can be asked without guessing.
//!
//! The user's query is *not* passed to FTS5 verbatim. A bare MATCH expression
//! makes half of ordinary typing a syntax error (`c++`, `foo:bar`, a stray
//! quote), so the query goes through the one shared parser in
//! [`crate::search`] (#0086a) and is lowered here by [`crate::search::to_fts`]
//! into a quoted `MATCH` expression plus the SQL predicates the contentless
//! index cannot carry (an attachment column test and a date range). That single
//! parser is what closes the #0043 two-grammar debt: `--local` and the server
//! path now read the same input. [`fts_expression`] survives as a thin renderer
//! for the callers and tests that only want the `MATCH` string.
