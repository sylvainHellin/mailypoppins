//! What survives a drop-and-rebuild (#0066).
//!
//! [`super::Store::open`] answers an unusable store file by deleting it and
//! creating an empty one, because `messages` and everything derived from it is
//! a cache the next sync refills. The `outbox` is the one table that is not:
//! it is the record of what has been submitted to a mail server, and
//! `mp outbox list|retry|discard` presents it as durable send state. So the
//! rebuild does three things beyond creating the file:
//!
//! 1. Before the drop, it reads the old `outbox` back defensively (by column
//!    name, tolerating a schema that is not the current one) and carries every
//!    unfinished row into the fresh file, together with a reference on the raw
//!    RFC822 blob it points at. `done` rows have nothing outstanding and are
//!    not carried.
//! 2. It then sweeps the blob tree, deleting every file the rebuilt store has
//!    no refcount row for. Without this, a rebuild leaves the whole blob
//!    directory orphaned: the files survive, the refcounts do not, and nothing
//!    ever reclaims them. The carried outbox rows are exactly what keeps their
//!    own bytes alive through the sweep.
//! 3. It writes a `store-rebuild-<timestamp>.txt` note next to the store when
//!    outbox rows were involved, so a discarded submission is never silent.
//!
//! `pending_ops` (#0039) is deliberately **not** carried, unlike the outbox it
//! otherwise mirrors. A pending mutation is a flag, move or delete of a message
//! the server still holds, so a queued-but-undrained row that a rebuild drops
//! costs at most a redone flag or a delayed move, never a lost message: the next
//! full sync restates the server's truth over the dropped optimistic write. The
//! outbox is carried because a submission to a mail server is a side effect no
//! sync can reconstruct; a pending mutation is not, so dropping it is safe and
//! the rebuild stays a cache rebuild for this table.
//!
//! The read is row by row on purpose. The file reaching this module has
//! usually failed an `integrity_check`, and a damaged page ends a SQLite scan
//! for good: `Rows::advance` resets the statement on a step error, so every
//! later `next()` says "no more rows" and a single scan would lose the whole
//! tail without noticing. So the salvage lists the rowids first and reads one
//! row per query, which costs one row per damaged page instead of all of
//! them. A listing that stopped early is itself a btree walk that stopped
//! early, and it carries no `ORDER BY`, so the positions it never named are
//! not simply the ones above the highest it reached: the salvage goes back
//! over every position between the first and `MAX(rowid)` that the listing did
//! not name, within the same budget, and whatever is still unreachable is
//! counted against `COUNT(*)` and named in the note (#0066 review follow-up).
//!
//! The sweep assumes the rebuild is the only thing touching the account
//! directory: a blob written by a concurrent ingest whose row has not
//! committed yet would be swept as an orphan. The cost is a refetch, which is
//! the same cost the rebuild itself pays. It walks `<account_dir>/blobs/` only
//! when that is a real directory: a symlinked blob root is left alone, both
//! because deleting through it would reach files the rebuild has no business
//! touching and because a user pointing `blobs/` at another disk deserves
//! their tree back intact.
//!
//! Nothing here is allowed to fail an open. A store that cannot be salvaged is
//! still a store; every error below is logged and stepped over.
