//! Per-account SQLite store.
//!
//! One `store.sqlite3` per account directory, opened in WAL mode with a 5 s
//! busy timeout and `synchronous = NORMAL`. The file is a cache in front of
//! IMAP rather than a system of record (with one exception, the `outbox`
//! below), so there is no migrator: a version mismatch, a failed
//! `integrity_check` or a file that cannot be opened as a database is dropped
//! and rebuilt, with a log line and no user-visible error. The next sync
//! refills it. The `integrity_check` behind that contract is a full walk of
//! the file, so it runs once per file per process (see [`INTEGRITY_CHECKED`])
//! rather than on every open.
//!
//! ## What survives a rebuild
//!
//! "A cache" is true of every table but one, so the rebuild is not quite an
//! empty file (#0066, implemented in [`rebuild`]):
//!
//! - `messages`, `message_blobs`, `messages_fts`, `mailboxes`, `sync_cursors`,
//!   `drafts`, `pending_ops` and `meta` are dropped. The server holds the
//!   first five back, the drafts directory on disk is truth for `drafts`,
//!   `pending_ops` is shape only so far (#0039), and `meta` is stamped afresh
//!   by [`schema::create`].
//! - `outbox` is carried: every row still in `pending_send`,
//!   `sent_pending_append` or `failed` is read out of the old file before it
//!   is deleted and written into the new one, with its raw RFC822 blob
//!   reference. It is the record of what has been submitted to a mail server,
//!   which no sync can reconstruct. `done` rows owe nothing and are not
//!   carried. A row that cannot be carried (its bytes are gone from the blob
//!   store, its columns are unreadable) is named in a
//!   `store-rebuild-<timestamp>.txt` note written next to the store, never
//!   dropped silently, and so is a stretch of the old file that would not be
//!   read at all. A row whose exactly-once marker was written but cannot be
//!   read is carried as `failed`: a message that may already have reached a
//!   mail server is parked for a human, never re-submitted.
//! - Blob *files* whose refcount row did not survive are deleted by the same
//!   pass, so a rebuild cannot leave the blob directory full of orphans that
//!   nothing reclaims. The blobs the carried outbox rows point at are what the
//!   sweep keeps. It walks `<account_dir>/blobs/` only when that is a real
//!   directory; a symlinked blob root is left untouched rather than deleted
//!   through.
//!
//! This module knows nothing about IMAP, MIME or Markdown. It owns the file,
//! the pragmas and the schema; everything above it speaks SQL.
//!
//! Bodies, raw messages and attachments do not live in the database: they go
//! to the content-addressed blob store in [`blobs`], and rows keep only the
//! hash. The `blobs` table here is that store's refcount index, so a reference
//! can be taken in the same transaction as the row that holds the hash.
