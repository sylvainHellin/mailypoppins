//! There is no migrator and there never will be one: the store is a cache in
//! front of IMAP, so a version mismatch is answered by dropping the file and
//! rebuilding it (see [`super::Store::open`]). That is why every statement
//! below is a plain `CREATE`, and why the only stateful thing in the file is
//! the `schema_version` row in `meta`. The one table that is not a cache,
//! `outbox`, is carried across that rebuild rather than recreated from a

///   it keeps a future shared database a schema change rather than a rewrite
///   of every query, and it is cheaper to carry the column than to explain per
///   table why this one is exempt. `sync_cursors` and `pending_ops` were the
///   two exceptions among those tables and are no longer. The convention does
///   not reach `meta` (file-scoped), `blobs` (content-addressed and shared by
///   construction), `message_blobs` (scoped by its `messages` foreign key) or
///   `messages_fts` (an index keyed on the `messages` rowid).
/// - `messages` has a synthetic `id` so a move or a UIDVALIDITY reset does not
///   invalidate references held elsewhere; `UNIQUE (account, mailbox, uid)` is
///   the real identity and the target of the ingest UPSERT.
/// - `messages_message_id` is deliberately non-unique. It serves threading,
///   idempotent re-ingest after cursor loss, cross-mailbox copy detection and
///   stale selector resolution, and is never on the hot ingest path.
/// - `drafts` is keyed by `(account, id)`, where `id` is the frontmatter field
///   written by `mp new`; the file on disk stays truth and this table is a
///   derived index.
/// - `outbox` carries the durable send state machine; the four states are
///   enforced by a CHECK so a typo in later code fails loudly.
///   `submission_started_at` is the exactly-once marker: it is committed
///   immediately before the SMTP session opens, so a `pending_send` row found
///   on restart says whether the transport was ever entered (see
///   [`crate::outbox`]). `envelope` is who the message is actually going to,
///   which the message bytes cannot answer: lettre drops the `Bcc` header when
///   it builds, so a resumed submission rebuilt from headers would lose every
///   blind recipient.
/// - `blobs` is the refcount index for the content-addressed blob store in
///   [`super::blobs`]. It lives here rather than on disk so a reference can be
///   taken in the same transaction as the `messages` / `outbox` row that
///   carries the hash; the file itself is the disposable side of the pair.
/// - `message_blobs` is the per-message list of blob references: one row per
///   `(message, kind, ordinal)`, where `kind` is `body`, `html`, `raw` or
///   `attachment`. `html` only appears for a backend that returns no RFC822
///   (Graph), where losing the HTML part would mean losing the body the user
///   actually wrote; an IMAP message keeps its `raw` blob and needs no second
///   copy. It is the *source of truth* for refcounting, and
///   `messages.body_blob` / `messages.raw_blob` are a convenience
///   denormalisation of the two singleton kinds. It exists because retention
///   evicts attachment blobs and body blobs on separate horizons, so eviction
///   and refcount auditing must be able to enumerate one row's blob
///   references with a query rather than a parse loop over a JSON column; it
///   is also what lets re-ingest release exactly the references whose content
///   actually changed. `ON DELETE CASCADE` keeps the list from outliving its
///   message, but the *refcount* is only decremented by an explicit
///   [`super::blobs::BlobStore::release`], never by the cascade.
/// - `messages_fts` is *contentless* (`content=''`) with `contentless_delete=1`,
///   over `subject`, `from_` and `body_text`. It was external-content over
///   `messages` until #0038 unit B, which is where the amendment comes from:
///   `messages` has no `body_text` column (the body lives in a blob), so the
///   index was already written by hand and never readable back, and the
///   external-content `'delete'` command needs the *old* column values to undo
///   an entry. Re-ingest could not always produce them (an evicted body blob),
///   so it skipped the delete and left the row indexed twice (the #0037 known
///   issue). `contentless_delete=1` makes `DELETE FROM messages_fts WHERE
///   rowid = ?` legal without any column values, which is the whole fix.
///   What stays true either way: only `rowid`-returning `MATCH` queries are
///   usable (`snippet()`, `highlight()` and selecting a column value all fail),
///   and there is nothing to rebuild from, because a store that loses its index
///   is dropped and refilled by the next sync.
/// - `sync_cursors.arrival_mark` is what a *later* pass is held to: the UID
///   above which the mailbox still owes the store a message the
///   server lists (a bulk move whose destination copies did not fit the
///   download window). Recomputing it from the stored UIDs cannot work, since
///   ingesting the top of the window raises that high-water mark above the
///   stragglers and declares the pass complete, which is exactly the loss the
///   prune gate exists to prevent (#0072). NULL means nothing is owed. Written
///   by the IMAP pull only; the Graph pull downloads by id, not by position,
///   and leaves it NULL.
/// - `sync_cursors` keeps the two resume points apart, because they are not
///   the same number: `last_uid` is the highest UID the recording fetch saw,
///   while `highest_modseq` is a CONDSTORE modification sequence. The IMAP
///   pull resumes from `known_uids_with_cursor` (the stored UID set plus
///   uidvalidity), not from `last_uid`, which is what #0041 and #0059 will
///   resume from once the pull is a delta rather than a window. What reads
///   `last_uid` today is the arrival gate, and only to tell an untouched
///   mailbox from one whose rows are gone: the *absence* of a cursor row is
///   first contact, where everything the server lists is backlog and no mark
///   may be persisted, while a row recording a top of 100 means a message
///   above 100 is an arrival even when the store holds nothing (#0072).
///   `highest_modseq` stays NULL until #0041 issues
///   `CHANGEDSINCE`, as does `deltalink` (Graph's `deltaLink`, waiting on
///   #0042). They were one column until #0054, which stored a UID in
///   `highest_modseq`: a UID-sized number read as a modseq makes the server
///   return nothing and no error, which is the #0004 failure mode with no
///   symptom.
/// - `ingest_failures` counts, per `(account, mailbox, uid)`, how many passes
///   have downloaded a message and failed to write it (#0074). A message that
///   was fetched and not written is as absent as one never fetched, so the pass
///   lowers the arrival mark below its UID and the prune gate stays shut until
///   some pass writes it. That is a deadlock in the making for a message the
///   store rejects deterministically, which is what this counter bounds: after
///   [`crate::ingest::MAX_INGEST_ATTEMPTS`] failed passes the UID is given up
///   on, stops holding the mark down, and the gate reopens. A successful ingest
///   deletes the row, so transient failures never accumulate towards the bound,
///   and a detected UIDVALIDITY reset deletes the mailbox's rows, because the
///   UIDs they are keyed by then name different messages (#0074 review). The
///   Graph path shares the counter: it has no arrival mark (an id-based pull
///   has no positional window), so there the bound only releases the prune
///   gate. Losing the table in a rebuild only costs the message its retries again,
///   which is the conservative direction.
/// - `pending_ops` is the durable mutation queue #0039 will drain; only its
///   shape lives here so far. `updated` is the last-attempt timestamp the
///   backoff is a function of (`updated + backoff_secs(attempts) > now`, the
///   formula `outbox` already uses), which `created` cannot answer.
