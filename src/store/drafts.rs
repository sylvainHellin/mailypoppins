//! The drafts index: a derived table over `<account_dir>/drafts/`.
//!
//! The file stays truth (#0050 scope item 5). Drafts are the only local-only
//! thing in the product: agents write `.md` files into the drafts directory
//! and `$EDITOR` rewrites them behind the application's back, so a table that
//! claimed to own them would be wrong within a second. What the table buys is
//! the *lookup*: `(account, id)` is the primary key, so a selector resolves in
//! one indexed read instead of a parse loop over the directory, and the TUI
//! and `mp list` read the same rows.
//!
//! Identity is the `id:` frontmatter field (decision C of the DAL plan), not
//! the filename, so renaming a draft keeps its selector working. A file
//! without one is assigned an id on the first refresh and the field is written
//! back, which is the only write this module ever makes to a draft.
//!
//! Freshness is a one-second [`fingerprint`] scan of that single `max_depth(1)`
//! directory of tens of files, plus an explicit [`refresh`] at engine start and
//! after any command that writes a draft. A `notify`-style watcher is a later
//! refinement and deliberately not a new dependency here.
