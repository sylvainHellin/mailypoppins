//! The write path: the optimistic local half of a flag, move or delete.
//!
//! Ingest owns the receive path ([`crate::ingest`]); this module owns the
//! mutations the *user* makes. Both write the same rows, and the split is
//! about direction rather than about SQL: what arrives from the server is
//! ingest's, what the user does to a message is here.
//!
//! ## Optimistic, then fire-and-forget
//!
//! Every function applies the change to the store immediately and returns the
//! coordinates the row had before it (a [`MutatedRow`]), which is what the
//! caller hands to the server op it fires next and what it puts back when that
//! op fails. The durable queue that would survive a crash between the two is
//! [#0039](../../docs/tickets/0039-pending-ops-queue.md); until it lands this
//! is exactly the durability the pre-store build had, where the local half was
//! a file move and the rollback was moving the file back.
//!
//! ## Moves renumber the uid
//!
//! `messages` is unique on `(account, mailbox, uid)`, so a row cannot carry its
//! source UID into a destination that already holds that number. A moved row
//! therefore gets `uid = -id`: negative is a value no backend produces (IMAP
//! UIDs are unsigned, and [`crate::ingest::graph_uid`] clears the sign bit) and
//! the row id makes it unique, so it reads as "moved locally, not yet seen
//! there by a sync". The next sync of the destination finds the row through the
//! `message_id` index and writes the real UID over it, which is the same rebind
//! a UIDVALIDITY reset takes.
//!
//! ## Delete removes the row
//!
//! There is no tombstone. The store is a droppable cache in front of the
//! server, so the honest answer to "the server delete failed" is the one the
//! status line already gives, `Sync (F) to fix?`: the UID is no longer in the
//! mailbox's skip list, the next sync refetches it and ingest re-inserts the
//! row. A tombstone would be local state that the server cannot contradict,
//! i.e. a second source of truth, and the durable form of that intent is the
//! `pending_ops` row of [#0039](../../docs/tickets/0039-pending-ops-queue.md).
