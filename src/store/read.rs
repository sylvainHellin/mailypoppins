//! The read path: mailbox listings, per-mailbox counts and Message-ID lookups.
//!
//! Everything the TUI and `mp dump-mailbox` show comes from here, and nothing
//! here touches the filesystem tree. There is deliberately no fallback to a
//! directory walk: after [#0037](../../docs/tickets/0037-sqlite-store-engine-skeleton.md)
//! nothing writes `.md`, so a row that is missing is a bug in ingest, and a
//! walk that quietly produced the message anyway would hide it.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! Listings are ordered in SQL by `date_sort DESC`, with the row `id` as the
//! tiebreaker so two messages that share a timestamp keep a stable, total
//! order across runs. `date_sort` is the unix timestamp ingest derived from
//! the `Date:` header, and `0` is its "unparseable or absent" marker (see
//! [`crate::ingest`]); undated mail therefore sorts last, which is where the
//! pre-store build put it too.
//!
//! ## Blobs
//!
//! A row carries a `body_blob` hash, not the body, and the listing functions
//! never resolve one: a mailbox load is rows only (#0038 scope item 5). The
//! body is fetched when something actually needs it, by [`load_body`] for the
//! previewed message. The batch reader that once fed the in-list body-search
//! index (`load_bodies`) left with that index (#0088): body search is the FTS
//! path now, so nothing reads a whole mailbox of blobs at once anymore.
//!
//! Both degrade an unreadable blob to an empty body rather than an error: the
//! retention sweep is allowed to evict a body, and an evicted body must not
//! blank a list or fail a search.
//!
//! ## Invites
//!
//! An invite is a row with an attachment blob named [`CALENDAR_SIDECAR_NAME`],
//! and the listing carries that as a boolean column computed by an `EXISTS`
//! subquery ([`MessageRow::is_invite`]). The badge therefore costs one index
//! probe per row inside the query that was already running, and no blob read:
//! the ics is only fetched where its contents are actually rendered, by
//! [`load_invite_ics`] for the previewed message and by [`list_invites`] for
//! the agenda (#0038 scope item 6).
