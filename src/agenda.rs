//! The local agenda (#0034): the rows `calendar.events` serves, built from the
//! iMIP messages the store already holds.
//!
//! It was `tui::app::calendar_view` until #0126 (P5-U10c-I2), which is what a
//! daemon method reaching into the TUI for its own answer looked like. It
//! reads a store and a blob store, so it is the engine's; what it produces is
//! [`mp_protocol::calendar::AgendaEvent`], the wire row, which is what both
//! ends already spoke. The TUI decodes one into its own `CalendarEvent`
//! whether it came off the socket or off this function, so there is one
//! agenda and one dedup.
//!
//! This is deliberately local-first and **blind to Outlook-created events**:
//! only invitations that arrived (or were sent) by email exist locally, so an
//! event created directly in Outlook is invisible here until the Graph sync
//! backend lands (#0036). The UI states that caveat in the pane.
//!
//! Since #0038 scope item 6 the source is the store, not the `.md` tree: the
//! rows that carry an `invite.ics` attachment blob, with that blob parsed as
//! the single authority for UID, SEQUENCE, DTSTAMP and every displayed field.
//! There is no frontmatter cache left to drift from it, and no directory walk
//! to be fooled by a sender-controlled `.md` attachment (TKT-0047's exposure
//! is gone by construction; #0040 closes the ticket formally).
//!
//! Attendee statuses and our own RSVP are folded in from the REPLY rows by
//! [`crate::reconcile`], which computes them rather than storing them. The
//! whole agenda is therefore rebuilt from rows and blobs on demand, and the
//! client keeps it until the user refreshes it (`r`) or switches account,
//! exactly as the walk-based build was.
//!
//! Cost: one indexed join over `messages` plus one blob read per invite row.
//! Invites are a rare row, the blobs are a few kilobytes, and none of it runs
//! at cold start: the agenda is built the first time the Calendar view is
//! opened, never during `App::new`.
