Search emails with one grammar that every backend speaks.

Fields (combine freely, implicit AND between them):
  from:  to:  cc:  subject:  body:  filename:   match a field
  has:attachment                                 only mail with an attachment
  before:YYYY-MM-DD  after:YYYY-MM-DD             a date range (since: aliases after:)
  in:MAILBOX                                      scope to one mailbox
  message-id:<id>                                 exact Message-ID lookup

Operators:
  \"a phrase\"        a quoted phrase is one term
  a OR b            either term
  (a OR b)          a parenthesised OR group, AND-ed with the rest

Examples:
  mp search 'from:boss@corp.com (invoice OR receipt) has:attachment'
  mp search --from boss@corp.com --has-attachment 'invoice OR receipt'
  mp search 'subject:\"quarterly report\" after:2026-01-01 before:2026-07-01'
  mp search --local 'from:ada ledger'

Backend honesty: on Gmail and Exchange every term runs server-side. On plain
IMAP has:attachment has no server key, so it is answered from the local store
(synced mail only) and the run prints a warning. filename: is Gmail/Exchange/
--local only.";
