//! Store-only ingest: fetched message to one `messages` row plus its blobs.
//!
//! This is the only writer on the receive path, and it writes no `.md`.
//! Everything a fetched message carries ends up in exactly two places: the
//! per-account `store.sqlite3` row and the content-addressed blob store.
//!
//! ## Bodies, and the HTML the Graph path would otherwise lose
//!
//! Every message stores its plain-text body as a `body` blob. An IMAP message
//! also stores the RFC822 bytes as a `raw` blob, so any richer rendition can be
//! re-derived from them. Graph never returns RFC822, so its HTML part is
//! stored as an `html` blob instead; without it the HTML the sender wrote is
//! gone the moment the message is ingested.
//!
//! ## Transaction shape
//!
//! Blob *files* are written before the transaction opens and blob *references*
//! are taken inside it, which is the contract documented on
//! [`BlobStore::acquire`](crate::store::BlobStore::acquire): an unreferenced
//! blob file is a harmless orphan that a sweep reclaims, while a row pointing
//! at a missing blob is a hole in the read path. One transaction per message,
//! so a crash leaves whole messages behind, never half of one.
//!
//! ## Identity, and what re-ingest does
//!
//! Identity is `(account, mailbox, uid)`. Re-ingesting the same UID is an
//! UPSERT on that unique constraint: the row keeps its `id`, its thread
//! assignment and any local-only state, and blob references are re-pointed
//! only for the kinds whose content actually changed (new references are
//! acquired before old ones are released, so a hash shared by both versions
//! never touches zero and never gets unlinked mid-transaction).
//!
//! After a UIDVALIDITY reset the same message reappears under a new UID. The
//! non-unique `messages_message_id` index finds the prior row in the same
//! mailbox, and ingest updates its `uid` in place rather than inserting a
//! second row, so the thread assignment and the blob references survive the
//! renumbering.
//!
//! That rebind is gated by a [`RebindPolicy`] the caller supplies (#0112).
//! Taken unconditionally it also swallows the case a server-as-truth mirror
//! has to be able to hold: a mailbox carrying several server-side copies of
//! one `Message-ID`. Each copy would land on the same row and flip its `uid`
//! to whichever copy was ingested last, so the other copies are absent from
//! the skip list on the next pass, are reported new, are downloaded in full,
//! and rebind the row back, forever.
//!
//! ## Synthesised Message-ID
//!
//! A message with no `Message-ID` header gets `sha256-<hex16>@local.invalid`,
//! where `<hex16>` is the first 16 lowercase hex characters of a SHA-256 over
//! bytes that are fixed as follows, so the same message always synthesises the
//! same id:
//!
//! - when the ingest holds the raw RFC822 bytes (every IMAP fetch), the digest
//!   is over those bytes exactly as they came off the wire;
//! - when it does not (the Graph path never returns RFC822), the digest is
//!   over the canonical envelope string
//!   `from \n to \n cc \n subject \n date \n body_text`, UTF-8, with `cc`
//!   rendered as the empty string when absent and no trailing newline.
//!
//! ## FTS
//!
//! `messages_fts` is contentless with `contentless_delete=1` (see the schema
//! doc comment), so there is nothing to rebuild from and ingest maintains the
//! index explicitly: delete the previous entry by rowid, insert the new one,
//! both inside the message's transaction.
//!
//! The delete needs the rowid and nothing else, which is what fixes the #0037
//! known issue: while the index was external-content, undoing an entry meant
//! replaying the *old* column values, and re-ingest of a message whose
//! previous body blob had been evicted could not produce them, so it skipped
//! the delete and left the row indexed twice.
