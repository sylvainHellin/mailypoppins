//! One engine per account, across processes (#0061, folded into #0039).
//!
//! The data-access-layer plan specifies a single-writer engine guarded by a
//! non-blocking advisory lock on `<account_dir>/store.lock`
//! (`docs/plans/data-access-layer.md`). SQLite's own WAL locking serialises
//! individual writes but cannot express "one engine for the lifetime of the
//! process": its locks are scoped to a transaction. This is the missing piece.
//!
//! The lock exists because two drains of the durable `pending_ops` queue racing
//! on the same rows is where the absent lock turns from wasteful (two syncs
//! double-ingesting) into destructive (two engines running the same op twice,
//! or racing a row's state transitions). `mp sync` in one terminal and an open
//! TUI in another are both live writers today, so the exposure is real now.
//!
//! ## The protocol
//!
//! - The first process to run an account's engine takes the lock and drains.
//! - A process that cannot take it degrades to read-only against the store: it
//!   still reads and it still *enqueues* `pending_ops` rows (a plain WAL write,
//!   serialised by SQLite), but it does not drain them. The lock-holder's
//!   engine drains what everyone enqueues.
//! - `flock` releases on `close(2)`, which the kernel does on exit and on a
//!   crash, so a dead holder's lock is free for the next process with no
//!   manual cleanup and no stale lock file to reap.
//!
//! ## Why `flock` and not a lock file with a pid
//!
//! A pid file is a lock a crash leaves held: the next process finds a pid that
//! is either dead or, worse, reused, and has to guess. `flock` is an advisory
//! lock the kernel owns, released the instant the holding fd closes however the
//! holder went away. The lock file itself is never deleted; only the advisory
//! lock on it moves between processes, so there is no unlink race.
//!
//! ## The daemon holds one for a runtime's whole lifetime (P5-U8)
//!
//! An account runtime takes the lock when it starts and keeps it until it
//! stops, which is what makes the daemon *the* engine rather than one more
//! process racing for it. That breaks the assumption every guarded call site
//! made until then, because `flock` is per open file description rather than
//! per process: a `send.draft` inside that same daemon opening the lock file a
//! second time contends with its own runtime and would skip the drain it owes.
//!
//! So there are two entry points now. [`EngineLock::try_acquire_at`] is
//! unchanged and still means "take the lock": that is what a runtime does
//! (through [`EngineLock::hold_for_runtime`], which also announces it) and what
//! a test asks when it wants to know whether anybody holds it.
//! [`EngineLock::take_turn_at`] is what a guarded *pass* asks: inside the
//! process that already holds the lock it takes an in-process **gate** instead,
//! one pass at a time, which is exactly the invariant #0116 needs and without a
//! second description to contend with; everywhere else it is `try_acquire_at`
//! verbatim.
//!
//! Unix only. Windows is targeted through WSL, where this is a Linux binary.
