//! The transport-independent half of the receive path: the sync types every
//! backend speaks, and the [`SyncBackend`] seam the engine is driven through.
//!
//! Before #0059 these types lived in `imap_client`, and `graph.rs` imported
//! them from there: the abstraction existed, spelled as a dependency on the
//! other transport's module. They live here now, and the orchestration that
//! consumes them lives in [`engine`], so it can be driven offline by a fake
//! backend in tests (`engine`'s test module) instead of only against a server.
//!
//! What the seam is *for*, beyond the tests:
//!
//! - [`#0041`] wants one IMAP session held across mailboxes and a CONDSTORE
//!   `HIGHESTMODSEQ` remembered between passes. Both are backend state, and
//!   the trait takes `&mut self` so a backend may keep them.
//! - [`#0042`] wants Graph's `deltaLink` remembered between passes, which is
//!   the same shape of state behind the same `&mut self`.
//!
//! Neither is implemented here. The parity half of #0059, one orchestration
//! serving both transports, is parked with the Graph backend: `graph.rs` still
//! runs its own loop, and the engine below is driven by the IMAP backend only.
