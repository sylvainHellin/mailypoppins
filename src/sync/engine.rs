//! The sync orchestration, written once against [`SyncBackend`] (#0059).
//!
//! Everything here used to live inside `imap_client::store_sync::sync_mailboxes`
//! between the network calls, which is why none of it had a test: driving it
//! meant standing up an IMAP server. The transport is now a trait parameter, so
//! the loop below runs offline against a fake backend and the properties it is
//! responsible for, the arrival mark, the ingest-failure bound, the flag
//! application, the cursor, and the deferred prune pass, are pinned through the
//! real code path rather than re-walked by hand in a composition test.
//!
//! What it is *not*: a Graph orchestrator. `graph.rs` still runs its own loop
//! (the parity half of #0059 is parked with the Graph backend), and its #0074
//! bookkeeping mirrors the one here by hand as it did before.
