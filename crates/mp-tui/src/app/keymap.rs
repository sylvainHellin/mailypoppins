//! Keymap-as-data (#0032, subsumes #0019).
//!
//! A single static `KEYMAP` table is the source of truth for *which* key
//! bindings exist, *where* they are live (context model), how they group in
//! the help overlay, their human description, and — for the Normal-mode
//! surface — *what* they do (via [`KeyAction`]). Three former hand-kept copies
//! now derive from it:
//!
//! 1. the in-TUI help overlay (`ui/overlays.rs::help_sections`),
//! 2. the mode/hint bar (`ui/status.rs::render_hint_bar`),
//! 3. the website key table (`mp dump-keys` -> `website/src/pages/*`).
//!
//! ## What the table owns
//!
//! The table owns the *catalogue* of user-facing bindings: pattern, context,
//! group, description, guard, and (for leader chords) the prefix. For the
//! Normal-mode surface (no overlay active) it also owns *dispatch*: `keys.rs`
//! resolves the pressed key through [`resolve`] into a [`KeyAction`] that a
//! single executor runs. See "(B)-lite runtime dispatch" below.
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** own the *execution* of deeply stateful,
//! context-sensitive overlay input (selection-vs-single confirmation dialogs,
//! compose-wizard field editing, dir-picker navigation, incremental search
//! input, confirm y/n, activity filter/scroll, help filter/scroll). Those stay
//! hand-coded in `keys.rs` — expressing them as flat table rows would force a
//! redesign of overlay input handling (the ticket's stop rule). They still get
//! catalogue rows ([`KeyAction::Manual`]) so help/hint/website document them.
//!
//! Every binding that appears in the help overlay is listed here; the
//! `keymap_covers_help` / no-duplicate tests guard that invariant.
//!
//! ## Leader / prefix model
//!
//! A binding may declare a single-key `prefix`. The leaders are the `Space`
//! view switcher (`Space m/c/a`, #0033), the Vim `g` motion prefix, and the
//! five mnemonic family leaders `f`/`c`/`g`/`t`/`s` (#0092: find, compose, go,
//! thread, system). The chord matcher only fires a prefixed binding when the
//! matching prefix is pending; `handle_key` sets `App::pending_prefix` to the
//! armed leader when a bare prefix key is seen (the hint bar and the which-key
//! popup then show the pending continuations). Strict prefix mode (see
//! [`resolve`]): while a prefix is pending only that family's continuations are
//! eligible, so a key that is not a continuation cancels the chord instead of
//! firing a flat binding (which-key semantics), and the leaders never
//! cross-arm.
//!
//! ## (B)-lite runtime dispatch
//!
//! For the Normal-mode surface `keys.rs` calls [`resolve`] with the active
//! [`KeyCtx`] (Global is always tried first, then the focused pane's context)
//! and the pending-prefix state. `resolve` returns the first matching row's
//! [`KeyAction`]; a single `execute` match in `keys.rs` runs it. The live
//! dispatch reads the same catalogue that drives help/hint/website, so they
//! cannot drift.
