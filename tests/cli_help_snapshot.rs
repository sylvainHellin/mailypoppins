//! Snapshot of the whole `mp --help` surface (#0049, unit 0b).
//!
//! `mp --help` is documented as the source of truth for the website's command
//! pages, and nothing pinned it: the CLI surface could change without a single
//! test noticing. This captures the top-level help and every subcommand's help,
//! recursively, as one document.
//!
//! parity, all of it. The new build must expose the same commands, arguments,
//! defaults and wording, or update the website pages under
//! `website/src/pages/` in the same commit. A diff here is a decision, never an
//! approval reflex.
//!
//! The help is captured by running the real binary rather than by rendering the
//! clap `Command` in-process, because the two are not the same: `--help` maps
//! to clap's short help for commands with no long help and to the long help for
//! the ones that have it (`mp dump-keys`), and an in-process `render_long_help`
//! would record a layout no user ever sees. `CARGO_BIN_EXE_mp` makes cargo
//! build the binary for this test, so no extra dependency is involved.
//! Deterministic: the `wrap_help` clap feature is off, so the width is fixed,
//! and `--help` short-circuits before any config or network access.
