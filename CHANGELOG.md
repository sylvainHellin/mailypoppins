# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **`accept_invalid_certs` is now restricted to loopback hosts.** The
  per-account cert-validation opt-out exists for Proton Mail Bridge,
  which always listens on `127.0.0.1` with a self-signed cert. It was
  previously honoured for *any* host, so a config pointing at a remote
  server with `accept_invalid_certs = true` would silently hand
  credentials to an active man-in-the-middle. All four TLS paths (IMAP
  connect, SMTP send, config-wizard connection tests, OAuth2 SMTP test)
  now call a shared guard (`ensure_invalid_certs_allowed` in
  `src/config.rs`) that refuses with a clear error when the flag is set
  for a non-loopback host (anything other than `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`
  or `::1`). Loopback behavior is unchanged. There is no override: no
  documented setup needs invalid certs on a remote host, and a user who
  genuinely does can tunnel through loopback.

- **Secret files are created with mode 0600 atomically.** The encrypted
  secrets store (`secrets.enc`) and OAuth2 token caches (`tokens/*.enc`)
  were written first and chmod'd 0600 afterwards, leaving a brief window
  where umask-default (often world-readable) permissions applied. A new
  shared helper (`write_secret_file_atomic` in `src/secrets.rs`) opens
  the temp file with `create_new(true)` and `mode(0o600)` so the
  restrictive mode holds from the very first byte, then renames over the
  destination -- overwrite semantics and crash-safe atomic replacement
  are preserved, and a stale temp file from a crashed run is cleaned up
  instead of blocking the write.

- **Saved HTML email bodies now carry a restrictive Content-Security-Policy.**
  Fetched HTML companions (`.html` next to the `.md`) are opened via
  `file://` in the default browser (`b` in the TUI), so a hostile email
  could previously run scripts and load remote tracking pixels. At save
  time we now inject
  `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'none';
  connect-src 'none'; img-src data: cid: file:">` into the HTML
  (`inject_csp_meta` in `src/parse.rs`): scripts and script-initiated
  network access are blocked, and remote (http/https) images -- i.e.
  tracking pixels -- are blocked by default. `file:` stays allowed for
  images because inline `cid:` references are rewritten to local
  `file://` attachment paths at save time; with scripts and connections
  blocked there is no exfiltration channel, so local images are safe.
  Sender-supplied CSP meta tags are stripped and replaced so our policy
  always wins; injection is idempotent on re-save. Applies to newly
  fetched emails (previously saved `.html` files are unchanged). No
  config opt-out for remote images yet: the save path does not currently
  receive the global config, so plumbing it through would touch four
  call sites -- deferred until someone actually wants remote images.

  *Hardened after security review:* the initial implementation searched
  for the first `<head>`/`<html>` in a lowercased copy of the HTML.
  Two blockers: (1) a fake head hidden in a comment
  (`<!--<head>-->`) or attribute value lured the tag to a spot the
  browser never parses as head content, fully neutralizing the CSP;
  (2) byte offsets computed on `to_lowercase()` output misalign in the
  original for characters like `İ` (U+0130, 2 bytes → 3 bytes), so a
  crafted email could panic the sync on a non-char-boundary slice. The
  tag is now *prepended* at the very start of the document (after a
  leading doctype) -- the HTML parser hoists an early `<meta>` into the
  implicitly created `<head>` before any attacker bytes are parsed, so
  no search and no offset math on transformed strings. The same
  Unicode-offset fix was applied to `ensure_utf8_charset` (worst case
  there was mojibake or the same panic). Regression tests cover
  comment-fake-head, attribute-fake-head, and the `İ` expansion case.

### Features
- **Configurable TUI color themes.** New top-level `theme = "..."` key
  in config.toml selects a named built-in theme, helix-style. Built-ins:
  `catppuccin-mocha` (the default -- reproduces the previous hardcoded
  appearance exactly), `catppuccin-latte` (light) and `tokyo-night`
  (plus case-insensitive aliases like `catppuccin`, `latte`,
  `tokyonight`). The old raw Catppuccin palette constants in
  `src/tui/theme.rs` were replaced by a semantic `Theme` struct
  (slots like `unread`, `selection`, `border_focused`, `error`, ...)
  so themes only map meanings to colors and the renderers in
  `src/tui/ui/` never hardcode a palette. The theme is resolved once at
  TUI startup into a process-wide `OnceLock`; an unknown name falls
  back to the default and logs a warning to the activity log instead of
  failing. `email config show` prints the active theme; `config init`
  templates include the key. Website config page documents the option.
  Closes [#0023](docs/tickets/0023-enable-theme-config.md).

- **Open the log file from the TUI.** New global hotkey `Ctrl+l`
  suspends the TUI and opens the newest daily log file
  (`<data_dir>/logs/mailypoppins-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) in `$EDITOR`, using
  the same suspend/restore mechanism as draft editing. Complements the
  in-app activity log overlay (`L`) which only shows recent status
  messages -- the log file carries full debug-level detail. If no log
  file exists yet, a warning status message is shown instead. Newest
  file is picked by filename (`latest_log_file` in `src/config.rs`;
  daily-dated names make lexicographic order equal date order). Help
  overlay and website `commands.astro` updated alongside.
  Closes [#0025](docs/tickets/0025-access-detailed-logs.md).

- **Mark approved drafts back as draft.** New TUI hotkey `D` in the
  email list demotes an approved draft back to `draft` status -- the
  exact reverse of `A`. Useful when `A` was pressed by mistake or
  the draft needs another round of edits before sending. Single-email
  path is direct (no confirm, since it is non-destructive and fully
  reversible by `A`); multi-select uses the same confirm dialog
  pattern as `BatchApprove`. Status guard rejects `sent` / `inbox` /
  `archived` so we never silently rewrite a synced server email.
  CLI parity via `email mark-draft <file>`. Help overlay and website
  pages (`commands.astro`, `faq.astro`) updated alongside.
  Closes [#0021](docs/tickets/0021-mark-as-draft.md).

- **Auto-fetch on TUI startup.** Each account now runs an automatic
  per-account quick sync at launch, so mail that arrived between TUI
  sessions appears without pressing `s`. New `Action::FetchAccount(idx)`
  variant performs a quick sync against a specific account using that
  account's own `imap_config` / `graph_config` / `message_id_index` /
  `mailbox_states`; the trigger lives in the `BgResult::IndexReady`
  handler in `src/tui/bg.rs`, so each account fires as soon as its own
  index lands -- a slow reconcile on one account does not block a fast
  one. Local-only accounts (no IMAP, no Graph) are skipped. Combined
  with #0002, the cold-start fetch is now the warm-state ~1-2 s path
  instead of the previous 14 s reconcile, so the user sees fresh mail
  almost immediately. Closes [#0001](docs/tickets/0001-auto-fetch-on-tui-startup.md).

### Performance
- **Search narrows incrementally per keystroke.** Appending a
  character in `/` or `\` search now retain-filters the current
  visible set instead of rescanning the full mailbox: substring
  matching is monotone under query extension, so the new match set is
  a subset of the previous one and each keystroke only tests the
  emails that still matched the previous prefix (a big win for content
  search, which lowercases whole bodies per comparison). The needle is
  lowercased once per keystroke. Backspace and query resets recompute
  from the full list, as do appends where lowercasing rewrites earlier
  characters (Greek capital sigma is context-sensitive: "ΘΕΟΣ" lowers
  to "θεος" but "ΘΕΟΣΦ" to "θεοσφ", so the extended query can match
  entries the shorter one missed) — the narrow path is taken only when
  the old lowercased query is a prefix of the new one. Unit tests
  assert narrow-equals-full equivalence, stale-index safety, and the
  final-sigma fallback.
- **Mailbox switches, account switches and search no longer deep-clone
  the email list.** Cache slots and the active list are now
  `Arc<Vec<EmailEntry>>` (P2): switching mailboxes/accounts and
  delivering a background `MailboxLoaded` result share the allocation
  (`Arc::clone`) instead of cloning every entry (each `EmailEntry`
  carries the full parsed body -- on a multi-thousand-email mailbox
  every switch previously copied megabytes). The search filter is now a
  `visible: Vec<usize>` index view over the unfiltered list instead of
  a cloned filtered `Vec`; rendering, navigation, selection and all
  actions resolve the selected email through this indirection
  (`App::selected_email` / `visible_emails`), so actions under an
  active filter still target the right underlying entry. Mutations
  (optimistic archive/delete removal, read-flag updates) go through
  `App::with_emails_mut`, which drops the cache slot's strong reference
  first so `Arc::make_mut` mutates in place in the common case and
  re-shares the updated Arc with the slot afterwards -- a deep clone
  only happens when another owner (the per-account cache mirror from
  `save_to_account`) still shares the allocation. Behavior preserved:
  cursor clamping on switch/removal, ordering, read-status display,
  empty-search shows all, optimistic list updates, and the
  `MailboxLoaded` generation guard from the previous entry. One
  deliberate fix on top: switching back to an account with a saved
  search query now reapplies the filter instead of silently showing
  the unfiltered cache. Unit tests cover the visible-index mapping,
  removal-under-filter, and Arc sharing (`src/tui/app/keys.rs`).
- **Mailbox loads no longer block the UI thread.** `load_emails`
  (walkdir + frontmatter parse of every `.md` in a mailbox, seconds on
  large mailboxes) previously ran synchronously on every cache miss:
  post-fetch reloads, editor returns, and sidebar/hotkey mailbox
  switches would all freeze the TUI. The walk now runs on a background
  thread (following the `BgResult::IndexReady` pattern) via a new
  `Action::LoadMailbox` / `BgResult::MailboxLoaded` pair; the spinner
  shows while it runs. Same-mailbox reloads keep the stale list visible
  until the fresh entries arrive (no flicker, no empty state), then swap
  it in with the cursor clamped as before. Cache-miss switches to a
  *different* mailbox (or account) show an empty list with a
  "Loading <mailbox>..." status instead of the previous mailbox's
  content. Stale results are dropped via account/mailbox index checks
  plus a generation counter (`App::mailbox_load_generation`) that is
  bumped on every request and on optimistic archive/delete list
  mutations, so an out-of-order or pre-mutation walk can never clobber a
  newer list or resurrect a removed email (guard logic + tests in
  `src/tui/bg.rs::mailbox_loaded_is_current`).
- **No-op fetches no longer invalidate caches or reload the open mailbox.**
  `SyncResult` (IMAP and Graph) now carries `touched_dirs`: the local
  mailbox directories the sync actually modified on disk (new emails
  saved, read flags updated, duplicates removed, reconciliation
  moves/removals -- a move lists both source and destination). The TUI
  quick-sync paths thread this through `BgResult::Fetch`, and the
  handler in `src/tui/bg.rs` now: skips cache invalidation and the
  UI-thread mailbox reload entirely when nothing changed (the common
  case for IDLE-triggered fetches), and invalidates only the touched
  mailboxes' caches otherwise -- reloading the open mailbox only when it
  was among them. Full sync (`BgResult::Sync`) keeps the conservative
  invalidate-everything behavior, as does the error path
  (`touched_dirs: None`). Selection/scroll preservation in
  `reload_current_mailbox` is unchanged.
- **Saving fetched emails no longer triggers a full-directory re-scan per
  new email.** `save_fetched_emails_with_known_ids` now returns the
  `(message_id, path)` of every file it writes, and `sync_mailboxes`
  updates its in-memory index directly from those paths instead of
  re-walking the whole mailbox directory and substring-matching each
  Message-ID against full file contents (previously O(new_emails ×
  files), and a Message-ID quoted in another email's body could
  false-match). The TUI search-result save path uses the returned path
  too; its duplicate-hit fallback now looks up the Message-ID in
  frontmatter only (via `scan_mailbox_message_ids`) rather than
  substring-matching whole files. Both `find_file_by_message_id*`
  helpers are deleted. The Graph sync path never had this re-scan.
- **TUI cold start is now ~instant instead of ~1.4 s black screen.**
  `AccountState::new` no longer walks every mailbox directory to build
  the in-memory `message_id_index` synchronously. The scan is extracted
  into a free function `build_message_id_index` and dispatched on a
  background thread per account from `run_loop`; results arrive via the
  new `BgResult::IndexReady` variant, which sets `acct.message_id_index`
  and clears `acct.indexing`. The status bar shows "Indexing..." with
  the existing spinner; sync/fetch actions queue via the existing
  `bg_count > 0` gate and fire automatically when the last account
  finishes. Local benchmark: per-account `AccountState::new` dropped
  from 1183 ms / 234 ms (TUM / Proton) to 13 ms / 4 ms.
  Closes [#0003](docs/tickets/0003-cold-start-async-indexing.md).
- **First quick sync after launch is now <2 s instead of ~14 s.** Persist
  per-role IMAP `MailboxState` (`uid_validity`, `uid_next`, `exists`) to
  `<account_dir>/mailbox-states.json` after every successful Fetch /
  Sync, and reload it in `AccountState::new`. This lets the cold-start
  reconcile decision in `sync_mailboxes` take the state-based skip
  branch instead of falling through to a full Message-ID scan of INBOX +
  Archive. `uid_validity` mismatch on the next SELECT still falls back
  to a full reconcile, so other-client moves / mailbox renumbering
  remain safe. Closes [#0002](docs/tickets/0002-persist-mailbox-states.md).

### Fixed
- **Read/unread status now survives fetches and syncs reliably in both
  directions.** Three bugs conspired to make `\Seen`/`isRead` sync flaky
  (ticket [#0004](docs/tickets/0004-fix-read-unread-sync.md)):
  1. *Fetches clobbered in-flight local marks.* Sync captured the server
     read flags first and applied them to local frontmatter seconds
     later, so marking an email read while a sync was running (previewing
     mail during the startup auto-fetch, for instance) was silently
     reverted to the older server snapshot. The flag-apply helpers now
     take a snapshot cutoff captured before the server read and skip any
     file modified at-or-after it (with 1 s slack for coarse filesystem
     mtimes): the newer local state wins, and its own server propagation
     -- already in flight -- converges everything on the next sync.
  2. *Webmail read changes rarely propagated to local files (IMAP).* The
     quick-sync "adaptive probe" returned early when the newest 10 UIDs
     were all known -- the common no-new-mail case -- so read/unread
     changes made in another client on anything but the 10 newest
     messages never reached the local `read:` field. Pass 1
     (headers + FLAGS, ~50 bytes/msg) now always covers the full
     quick-sync window; pass 2 (body download) is still skipped when
     nothing is new, so the latency cost is one small FETCH.
  3. *Graph accounts could never mark some emails read.* The Graph read
     sync substring-matched `read: true` against the whole file, so an
     email whose body merely quoted that string was permanently stuck
     unread locally. Both backends now share the same frontmatter-aware,
     cutoff-guarded helper (`sync_local_read_flags`).
  Regression tests cover both backends through the shared helper in
  `tests/sync_integration.rs` and `src/imap_client/sync.rs`.
- **Graph attachment filenames are now sanitized before writing to disk.**
  The Graph fetch path used the server-provided attachment name verbatim, so a malicious sender could name an attachment `../../evil` and have it written outside the `_attachments/` directory.
  The name now goes through the same `sanitize_attachment_filename` helper the IMAP path already used, which replaces path separators and control characters and caps the length.
- **New-draft skeletons no longer hard-code `attachments: []`.**
  The CLI `email new`, TUI `n`, and compose wizard skeletons wrote flow-style `attachments: []`, which deserializes to `Some(vec![])` instead of `None` and diverges from every other empty frontmatter key.
  They now emit the bare `attachments:` key, matching `to:` / `cc:` / `reply_to:`, and the CLI/TUI skeletons are deduplicated into a shared `new_draft_skeleton` helper in `src/draft.rs`.
- **Forward drafts no longer break when the source email is archived.**
  `create_forward_draft` previously canonicalised the per-mailbox
  `<inbox>/<stem>_attachments/<file>` paths into the draft frontmatter.
  As soon as the source moved (manually, or via reconcile after an
  archive on the server), the draft pointed at a path that no longer
  existed and `email send` failed with `Failed to read attachment`.
  Each fetched attachment is now also hardlinked into a per-account
  stable mirror at `<account>/attachments/<sanitized-message-id>/`
  (with a copy fallback on filesystems that disallow hardlinks).
  Forward drafts reference the stable path, which survives any
  subsequent inbox -> archive move. Pre-existing emails lazy-hydrate
  the stable dir on first forward, so the fix applies to historical
  mail without a one-shot migration. The reconcile "no longer on
  server" branch in `src/sync.rs` cleans up the stable dir alongside
  the per-mailbox copy. New helpers in `src/parse.rs`:
  `sanitize_message_id_for_path`, `stable_attachments_dir`,
  `link_or_copy`, `account_dir_for_email`. Closes
  [#0006](docs/tickets/0006-attachment-paths-after-archive.md).

### Changed
- **All app data moved to a single OS-conventional data directory.**
  Mail tree, drafts, contacts cache, OAuth2 tokens, and logs now live
  under `mailypoppins_data_dir()`:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mailypoppins/`
  - Linux (incl. WSL): `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mailypoppins/` (default `~/.local/share/mailypoppins/`)

  Layout: `accounts/<name>/{inbox,archive,sent,drafts,<extra>}/`,
  `accounts/<name>/contacts-cache.json`, `tokens/<name>.enc`, `logs/`.
  `~/.mailypoppins/` is retired entirely. Override the root with the
  `MAILYPOPPINS_DATA_DIR` env var (test seam + portable-install escape
  hatch).
- New `src/config.rs` helpers: `mailypoppins_data_dir`, `account_dir`,
  `mailbox_dir`, `drafts_dir`, `contacts_cache_path`, `tokens_dir`,
  `logs_dir`. Replace the removed `resolve_root_dir`,
  `resolve_mailbox_local_path`, `resolve_drafts_dir_from_config`,
  `resolve_dir`, `expand_path`, `log_base_dir`.
- Wizard prints the derived data-dir paths instead of asking the user to
  pick one. The Obsidian-vault workflow is preserved via a symlink hint:
  `ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/mailypoppins/accounts/<name> ~/notes/email/<name>`.

### Removed
- Per-account `[accounts.directories]` block (`root`, `drafts` keys).
- Per-mailbox `local = "..."` field on `[accounts.mailboxes.{inbox,archive,sent}]`
  and `[[accounts.mailboxes.extra]]`. `MailboxMapping` now carries only `server`.
- `email config migrate` subcommand (legacy single-account -> multi-account
  migrator). Per the v1.0 "no migrations" policy, configs that still use the
  old keys are rejected at parse time with a clear message instructing the
  user to re-run `email config init`.

### Breaking
- Existing configs containing `[accounts.directories]` or per-mailbox
  `local = "..."` fail to load. Run `email config init` to regenerate.
- Existing local mail trees at user-chosen roots (e.g. `~/notes/email/`)
  are no longer read or written. Re-run `email config init`, then
  `email sync` to repopulate the new data dir from the server. (Or move
  the existing tree manually into
  `<data_dir>/accounts/<name>/{inbox,archive,sent,...}/`.)
- OAuth2 token caches at `~/.mailypoppins/tokens/<account>.enc` are
  ignored. Re-run `email config oauth2-login --account <name>`.

### Added
- `dirs = "5"` dependency for cross-platform data-dir resolution.

### Fixed
- **Inbox sort key now respects hours / minutes across timezones.**
  `resolve_date` previously formatted the RFC2822 / RFC3339 timestamp
  in the sender's local offset, so two emails on the same calendar day
  sent from different timezones sorted by sender-local wallclock instead
  of by actual UTC instant -- making same-day ordering look random.
  The sort key is now normalised to UTC (`with_timezone(&chrono::Utc)`)
  before formatting; display strings stay in sender-local time so dates
  still match other clients. Regression test
  `test_resolve_date_sort_normalises_timezone` covers both branches.
  Closes [#0024](docs/tickets/0024-sorting-email-inbox.md).
- `email config init` and `email config add-account` no longer panic with
  "Cannot start a runtime from within a runtime" when the wizard reaches
  the IMAP test, OAuth2 device-code flow, or Graph folder discovery.
  `main` is `#[tokio::main]`, so the wizard's sync code paths now drive
  nested async work via a new `config_cmd::helpers::run_async_blocking`
  helper that detects the existing runtime and spawns a fresh one in a
  dedicated OS thread (mirrors `oauth2::load_or_refresh_token_blocking`).

## [0.8.0] -- previous

### Changed
- **Default password store switched from OS keyring to a machine-bound
  encrypted file** at `~/.config/email/secrets.enc`. Built on
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 + HKDF-SHA256 with the key derived from
  `machine-uid + getuid + app salt`. Pure Rust, zero prompts at runtime,
  identical UX on macOS, Linux, and WSL. The file is undecryptable on any
  machine other than the one that wrote it (defends against Time Machine /
  iCloud / Dropbox / accidental git commit leakage).
- OAuth2 token caches now stored encrypted at
  `~/.mailypoppins/tokens/<account>.enc` using the same crypto.
- New `email config reset-secrets` command -- wipes the secrets file and
  token caches, then walks each account prompting for re-entry. Use after
  a Time Machine restore to a new machine.
- `keyring` retained as an **opt-in backend** via
  `secrets_backend = "keyring"` in `~/.config/email/config.toml`.
- New `src/secrets.rs` module exposing `SecretsBackend` trait,
  `EncryptedFileBackend`, `KeyringBackend`, and `encrypt_blob` /
  `decrypt_blob` helpers reused by `oauth2.rs`.
- See [docs/secrets.md](docs/secrets.md) for the threat model, key
  derivation, file layout, and recovery procedure.

### Removed
- `scripts/codesign-macos.sh` and the `scripts/install.sh` wrapper. No
  longer needed -- secrets do not depend on a stable code-signing
  identity, so `cargo install --path .` is the canonical install command
  again.
- `keyring`-to-encrypted-file migration command. Per project policy ("no
  migration paths until v1.0"), users on the old keyring path re-enter
  passwords once via `email config init` or `email config set-password`.
- `windows-native` feature on the `keyring` crate. Native Windows is not
  a supported target (WSL only).

### Breaking
- After upgrading, run `email config init` (fresh setup) or
  `email config set-password <smtp|imap> --account <name>` for each
  configured account to populate `~/.config/email/secrets.enc`. Existing
  Keychain entries are ignored unless you opt into
  `secrets_backend = "keyring"` in `config.toml`.
- OAuth2 token cache file extension changed from `.json` to `.enc`. Run
  `email config oauth2-login --account <name>` to re-acquire and cache
  tokens for each OAuth2 / Graph account.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Contact autocomplete**: mine `from:`/`to:`/`cc:` headers from each
  account's local mail archive, filter noreply/bulk-domain noise, rank
  contacts with a tiered comparator (`sent_to` > `sent_cc` > `received`)
  and a 180-day-half-life frecency tiebreaker. Cached per account at
  `<root>/.contacts-cache.json`.
- New `email contacts` CLI subcommand tree:
  - `rebuild` (re)builds the index from local mail for one or all
    accounts.
  - `stats` shows totals and the top 10 ranked contacts for an account.
  - `search <query>` returns ranked fuzzy matches. `--parsable` emits
    tab-delimited `email\tname` lines compatible with mutt
    `query_command`, aerc `address-book-cmd`, himalaya-vim, and
    vim `completefunc` completion sources.
- **TUI compose wizard overlay** triggered by `n` (new) and `w`
  (forward), with a four-field form (`To`/`Cc`/`Bcc`/`Subject`), live
  fuzzy-matched suggestions under the focused address field, Tab
  cycling, Ctrl+g force-submit, Ctrl+u clear-field, and Esc cancel.
  Reply keys `r`/`R` stay direct-to-editor as before. Aerc-style split
  on the last comma so multi-recipient fields work naturally; accepted
  suggestions render as `"Display Name" <addr>, ` so the user can keep
  typing. Once submitted, the draft file is written with a populated
  frontmatter block and then handed off to `$EDITOR`.
- Incremental contacts-index hooks: every successful send (CLI or TUI)
  bumps the recipients' `sent_to`/`sent_cc` counters, and every sync
  merges freshly-fetched email headers into the active account's index,
  preserving historical `first_seen` dates. Both hooks are best-effort
  and no-op when no `.contacts-cache.json` exists yet.
- `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/codesign-macos.sh` for stable macOS
  code signing during local development. After one-time setup of a
  self-signed cert (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`), the Keychain no longer
  re-prompts on every `cargo install --path .` rebuild.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with build instructions, the macOS keychain setup
  walkthrough, and troubleshooting notes.
- `src/contacts/` module (`types`, `filter`, `rank`, `extractor`,
  `matcher`, `cache`, `hooks`) built on `nucleo-matcher` for fuzzy
  matching and `mailparse::addrparse` for robust multi-recipient
  header parsing.
- 47 new unit tests across filter, rank, extractor, matcher, hooks,
  and the wizard recipient-field normalizer (total now 236).

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` and project `CLAUDE.md` both now point at
  `./scripts/install.sh` as the canonical install command.
- TUI `n` key now opens the compose wizard instead of writing a
  skeleton directly. `Action::NewDraft` is kept as a dead-code
  fallback path.
- TUI `w` key now opens the wizard with the `Fwd:` subject
  pre-populated and attachments preserved through
  `create_forward_draft` before the frontmatter is patched with the
  wizard's edits.
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` is clean again: collapsed a nested
  `if` in `src/imap_client/sync.rs` that was already failing the lint.

### Fixed
- Creating a new email via the TUI `n` key now writes a fully populated
  frontmatter block (`to`/`cc`/`bcc`/`subject`/`from`/`date`) instead
  of an empty skeleton. Closes the "data is not added to the
  frontmatter" bug noted in `roadmap.md`.
- Wizard now strips trailing commas and whitespace from the
  `to`/`cc`/`bcc` fields before writing the draft, so contacts with
  display names that contain a comma (for example
  `"Doe, Jane" <addr>`) no longer break
  `mailparse::addrparse` and fail the subsequent send.

### Dependencies
- New: `nucleo-matcher = "0.3"`, `regex = "1"`, `serde_json = "1"` (the
  last one was already a transitive dep).
- Avoided `once_cell` as a direct dep by using `std::sync::LazyLock`
  (Rust 1.80+).

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Mark as read / unread: persistent local tracking via `read` field in frontmatter, synced with IMAP `\Seen` flag
- Auto-mark-as-read when previewing emails (cursor moves to a new email in Inbox/Archive/Extra mailboxes)
- Manual toggle with `m` key (single email or batch selection)
- Unread indicator in email list: blue `\u{f444}` dot for unread, bold text for unread, dimmed text for read
- Unread count shown in status bar (e.g. "3 unread")
- IMAP fetch now captures FLAGS alongside body (`BODY.PEEK[] FLAGS`), preserving server-side read status
- Bidirectional read status sync: server `\Seen` flag synced to local `read:` frontmatter on each fetch
- `mark_read_on_server()` / `mark_unread_on_server()` IMAP operations
- `update_read_status_locally()` for frontmatter file updates
- `sync_local_read_flags()` updates existing local emails' read status from server during fetch/sync
- 16 new tests for read/unread functionality (types, ops, sync, frontmatter)

### Changed
- Existing emails without `read:` field default to unread (backward compatible)
- Optimistic updates: local state updates immediately, server follows async with rollback on failure
- Pass 1 of two-pass fetch now also retrieves FLAGS, enabling read status sync for existing emails

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Deduplicated message-ID scanning: canonical `scan_mailbox_message_ids` in `parse.rs`, both `scan_existing_message_ids` and `scan_local_message_ids` delegate to it
- Replaced manual `format!()` YAML construction in `save_fetched_emails` with `SaveFrontmatter` struct + `serde_yaml` for correct special-character quoting
- Extracted shared `collapse_hyphens` helper to `types.rs`, used by all three slugify functions
- Email validation in `validate_draft` now uses `lettre::message::Mailbox` (RFC 5321) instead of naive `contains('@')` check
- Added `#[derive(Default)]` to `FetchCriteria` for cleaner construction

### Added
- 28 new tests for `imap_client` submodules (search.rs: 22, fetch.rs: 6), restoring coverage lost during module split
- `SaveFrontmatter` struct in `types.rs` for type-safe frontmatter serialization
- `collapse_hyphens` helper in `types.rs`

### Fixed
- Sync now uses cross-directory dedup: emails already stored in any local mailbox
  directory (e.g. Archive) are skipped when fetching from other mailboxes (e.g. INBOX).
  This prevents re-downloading archived emails if they still exist on the server's INBOX.
- Special characters in email subjects/senders no longer break frontmatter YAML
- Added diagnostic logging to server search: logs which IMAP mailbox each query targets,
  how many results each mailbox returns, and where search results are saved on disk.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Refactored large TUI and IMAP modules into focused submodules:
  - `src/tui/app.rs` (1863 lines) -> `src/tui/app/` with `mod.rs` (506), `types.rs` (616), `keys.rs` (824)
  - `src/tui/ui.rs` (1634 lines) -> `src/tui/ui/` with 8 submodules (sidebar, list, headers, preview, status, overlays, search, util)
  - `src/tui/mod.rs` (1304 lines) -> split into `mod.rs` (118), `actions.rs` (678), `bg.rs` (165), `helpers.rs` (367)
  - `src/imap_client.rs` (1530 lines) -> `src/imap_client/` with 6 submodules (fetch, sync, search, watch, ops, batch)
- No file exceeds 824 lines. Zero behavior change.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Testing infrastructure: 139 tests (110 unit + 29 integration), all offline, <0.5s
- Unit tests for: `parse.rs`, `types.rs`, `send.rs`, `draft.rs`, `config.rs`, `imap_client.rs`, `sync.rs`, `tui/app/types.rs`
- Integration tests: `tests/draft_integration.rs`, `tests/sync_integration.rs`, `tests/save_emails_integration.rs`

- Dev-dependencies: `tempfile`, `insta`

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- Proton Mail Bridge support via IMAP STARTTLS and self-signed certificate acceptance
- `accept_invalid_certs` config option for SMTP and IMAP (for Proton Bridge and other self-signed setups)
- IMAP STARTTLS connection mode for non-993 ports (automatic, port-based heuristic)
- Proton Bridge preset in `email config init` wizard (pre-fills localhost:1143/1025 with cert bypass)
- Multi-account support: N email accounts with independent IMAP/SMTP/directories/signatures
- New config format using `[[accounts]]` array in `config.toml`
- Per-account keyring namespacing (`smtp-password-{name}`, `imap-password-{name}`)

### Changed
- Config model: `[smtp]`/`[imap]`/`[directories]`/`[mailboxes]`/`[signatures]` are now nested under `[[accounts]]`
- `default_from` moved from `[smtp]` to `[[accounts]]`
- Status bar simplified: account labels + `? help` replace verbose hotkey hints
- `config set-password` now takes `--account` flag
